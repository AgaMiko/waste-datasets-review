# Waste datasets review

List of datasets with any kind of litter, garbage, waste and trash. Created during the [detectwaste.ml](https://detectwaste.ml/) project

Today, more than 300 million tons of plastic are produced annually. Plastic is everywhere and we constantly use it in our daily life.

The idea of **detect waste project** is to use Artificial Intelligence to detect plastic waste in the environment. Our solution will be applicable for video and photography. Our goal is to use AI for Good.

## TACO bboxes
Additional hand-labelled annotations for images from TACO dataset.  There are seven recognized waste categories:
* bio: food waste such as fruit, vegetables, herbs, used paper towels and
tissues,
* glass: glass objects such as glass bottles, jars, cosmetics packaging,
* metals and plastic: scrap metal and non-ferrous metal, beverage cans,
plastic beverage bottles, plastic shards, plastic food packaging, or
plastic straws,
* non-recyclable: residual rubbish such as disposable diapers, pieces of
string, polystyrene packaging, polystyrene elements, blankets,
clothing, or used paper cups,
* other: construction and demolition, large-size waste (e.g. tires), used
electronics and household appliances, batteries, paint and varnish
cans, or expired medicines,
* paper: paper, cardboard packaging, receipts, newspapers, catalogues,
and books,
* unknown waste: (highly decomposed and hard-to-recognize litter),
* and extra class background label without any litter: a sidewalk, a
forest path, a lawn

## UAVVaste
**Drone rubbish detection intelligent technology**
The UAVVaste dataset consists to date of 772 images and 3716 annotations. The main motivation for creation of the dataset was the lack of domain-specific data. The datasets that are widely used for object detection evaluation benchmarking. The dataset is made publicly available and is intended to be expanded.

## Plastic Waste DataBase of Images – WaDaBa
4000 images with detailed description of a plastic type (PET, PP, PE-HD...), object color, deformation level, dirtiness  and others. [classification]

The object were put on the research position and next photographed with first and second type of light. There were series carried out of 10 photographs with differ in the angle of the turnover for every object (in the vertical axis). Next the object was damaged to varying degrees: small, medium and large. For each type of destruction have been made 10 photographs. So considering all variants for every object 40 photographs were taken, multiplying it by the number of objects, 4 000 of photographs were created in the database.

**Download**:  Images free-to-download directly from website. Annotations available after signing license http://wadaba.pcz.pl/#download

## GLASSENSE-VISION
Home-supplies classification. It is not strict litter dataset but it gathers over 2000 images with objects well-spareted from background. Covers 7 main categories of (Banknotes, Cereals, Medicines, Cans, Tomato sauces, Water bottle, Deodorant stick) and 136 subcategories.

Glassense-Vision is a set of data we acquired and annotated to the purpose of providing a quantitative and repeatable assessment of the proposed method. The dataset includes 7 different use cases, meaning different object categories, where for each one of them we provide training (reference images used also to build dictionaries) and test images. All images in the dataset are manually annotated. The different use cases (object categories) can be grouped in three main geometrical types:

## Waste Classification Data v2
A variation about the **Waste Classification data**: extended by the new category "N" - Nonrecyclable added.

Over 25k images already divided into training data - 22564 + 2508 (N) images and test data - 2513 images + new 397 from category nonrecyclable. Three main categories: Organic (O) and recyclable  (R), and nonrecyclable (N). TRAIN folder contains 2508 images in the "N" directory.
The TEST folder contains 397 images in the "N" directory.
